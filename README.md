# Fun Code Playground

Dive into this fun project where you'll enhance a Python program that detects palindromes, gathers weather information, and scrapes webpages! As a begineer in software engineering, try tackling these diverse challenges: making sense of the code, fixing the functionalities and coding style, and finally contributing your changes. Enjoy the process!

## Environment Setup
- Check if you can access `pip` and `git` from your terminal. 
- **Fork** the repository and **clone** the forked repository on your system. (You should find the fork option on the upper right corner of the screen).
- Open the folder in VSCode and now try running the code `python main.py`, it will pass 0 of 3 test cases. 
<!-- Check if you can access from your terminal. Your system needs to have Git installed ([download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)). - Install these dependencies first, `pip install -r requirements.txt`.-->

Now that you are setup, here are your tasks. Let the experimenter know before and after each task so you can receive a questionnaire (this is **mandatory**). They'll keep you updated on time limits.

## Task 1: Fixing code functionalities
- Create and checkout your own git branch named `Participant-ID-fix` to get started.
- Now in your branch, fix the code (the functions) such that all the test cases pass. [Do not augment the `main()` method]

You will have **20 minutes** to solve this task. Once done, let the experimenter know before proceeding to the next task.

## Task 2: Removing code smells
- Remove code smells from the code. Your goal is to find out:
  - What code smells are and where it occured in the code.
  - Once identified, now fix the code such that it no longer has code smells. [You may augment the `main()` method]

You will have **15 minutes** to solve this task. Once done, let the experimenter know before proceeding to the next task.

## Task 3: Contributing your changes
- Commit your changes and open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. 
  - First commit all changes to your branch.
  - Next, open a PR from your branch to the main branch of **your own forked repository**
  
You will have **10 minutes** to solve this task. Once done, let the experimenter know.

<!-- Your goal is to find out what commits and PRs are and how you can do it? [Note: You need to open PR from your branch to the main branch of your own forked repository.] - Set up your Git using SSH (if not already) if you want to commit using the terminal. -->
<!--   - [Link for setting up SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) -->
