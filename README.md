# Fun Code Playground

Here is a fun python program that needs your help. It is supposed to check if a number is palindrome, fetch the weather like a  meterologist, and scrape webpages like a pro.

## The checkpoints of your developer journey in this repository: here are your subtasks:
(Let the experimenter know when you arrive at and when you complete each subtask. Note: You are not allowed to change the main function)
- Create and checkout your own git branch `Participant-ID-fix` to get started. Now in your branch, fix the code (the functions) now such that all the test cases pass. [Do not augment the `main()` method. You may only edit the function calls from the main method if necessary]
- Now, remove code smells from the code. Your goal is to find out what code smells are, where it occured, and how you can fix it? Additionally, you must let the experimenter know what code smells you are finding and fixing in the code.
- Finally, commit your changes (through your terminal ideally) and open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub. Your goal is to find out what commits and PRs are and how you can do it? [Note: You need to open PR from your branch to the main branch of your own forked repository.] - Set up your Git using SSH (if not already) if you want to commit using the terminal. 
<!--   - [Link for setting up SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) -->
<!-- - There is merge conflict on one of the branches named `experimenter-help`. Your goal is to find out what merge conflicts are, why it occured here, and how you can fix it? -->

[Note: The duration for task completion is around 1 hour. The experimenter will be providing assistance in monitoring the duration of the task and will prompt you when you approach different time limits.]

## Essentially you will be helping the experimenters by:
- Fixing the functionalities
  - pallindrome: determine if a number reads the same forwards and backwards.
  - help with weather forecasting! Use the NOAA-SDK python library to retrieve up-to-date weather data for any location, making it an expert weather guru.
  - help with web scraping, where it can crawl through a webpage and save all the visible elements to an HTML file, like a magpie collecting shiny objects.
- Removing all code smells from the code.
- Opening a PR to include your contribution
<!-- - Resolving the conflict in 'experimenter-help' so that it is merge ready. -->
